The solution works, however I am not really happy with the way I've set up the xhtml files. I had issues with the commandButtons and other such methods, where for some reason the action I defined absolutely would not run. I eventually didn't pursue on fixing this, as I didn't want to put too much time into this, as I had already spent about 5 hours on this. Not really happy with that, but that is why I haven't done the task E3 message page.

So, I didn't do E3 message page because of that. However, the backend part for the messages is there. Because I failed with the frontend for message, I also didn't do any selenium tests for it. I also added a page to add books, however, that is because I misread one of the instructions about inserting books. I kept it in the solution, because at the point I realized my mistake, I had alredy made the pages for it.

Entrypoint for running locally is LocalApplicationRunner, located under the test folder in frontend.
